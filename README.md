# Blackjack-Two-Agents
### Comparative program testing the capabilities of two agents to "solve" a game of Blackjack
Developed with the help of Elias Misoliades (mitsolides.e@husky.neu.edu), this program pits a dealer running a simple heuristic against an Expectimax agent and a Q-Learning agent to determine which is the best at winning hands of Blackjack.

Currently, modifying test variables requires in-code modification although that would be simple to add as commandline args.
